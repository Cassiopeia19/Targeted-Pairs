# Targeted-Pairs
Challenge:  Find all of the pairs of numbers that sum to the target number
Two parameters:  Array of integers (negatives, positives / sorted or unsorted) and a single integer (target number)
As in the previous challenge of **Count the twos**, I utilized a TreeSet so that I could have the an ordered set.
I also used Random, so that the positive and negative integers could be randomly selected, as well as 'no repeats'
The user will be prompted to enter a target number.
Once entered, the app will determine which pairs sum up to that target number, print out the pairs, and then print out the total number of possible pairs.
